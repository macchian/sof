# CAVS gain (volume) capture pipeline
#
# A simple gain (volume) pipeline. All attributes defined herein are namespaced
# by alsatplg to "Object.Pipeline.gain-capture.N.attribute_name".
#
# Usage: gain-capture pipeline object can be instantiated as:
#
# Object.Pipeline.gain-capture."N" {
# 	format		"s16le"
# 	period		1000
# 	time_domain	"timer"
# 	channels	2
# 	rate		48000
# }
#
# Where N is the unique pipeline ID within the same alsaconf node.
